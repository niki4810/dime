# dime
A simple finance management app.


# About the application
- `dime` app lets your record your daily spending activity by category and show's you a neat summary of your spending status per month. I personally use this app to see how much I spend each month and limit my spending when I am reaching a treshold :).
- `dime` also has a chart view that shows spending by category.
- This app is built using `react`, `redux`, `react-router v4`, `react-jss`, `storybook`. (planning to use `redux-sagas` shortly).
- NOTE: I created this app for self learning purpose and there may be
a cleaner way to approch few things. This app will be evolving, and I plan to make it a PWA shortly.
- If you feel you can improve anything in the app, please feel free to open a PR.
